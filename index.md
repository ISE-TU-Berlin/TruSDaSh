Wellcome to the first Trustworthy Scalable Data Sharing Workshop (TruSDaSh), co-located with the 19th Research Challenges in Information Science (RCIS) conference in Seville, Spain, 20 - 23 May, 2025.

Continuous and incessant data production has transformed data ownership into an increasingly important asset for companies. However, the value assigned to data sets is a direct consequence of how the data can be used and shared between data owners and stakeholders. Given the increasing demand for data, this requires sophisticated mechanisms for discovering suitable data sets, as well as for transforming and consuming data in highly distributed architectures.

To that extent, there exists an urging gap for automation frameworks that simplify data exchange between providers and consumers, namely for: (i) publishing data sets, (ii) generation of data usage agreements or contracts between parties, (iii) safe and contractual data exchange, and (iv) monitoring both during the exchange and during the consumer's use of the data obtained.

The purpose of the workshop is to bring together researchers and practitioners in the field of data architecture and data management with the aim of sharing ideas, perspectives and new solutions for scalable data sharing.
