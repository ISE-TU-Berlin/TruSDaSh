Continuous and incessant data production has transformed data ownership into an increasingly important asset for companies. However, the value assigned to data sets is a direct consequence of how the data can be used and shared between data owners and stakeholders. Given the increasing demand for data, this requires sophisticated mechanisms for discovering suitable data sets, as well as for transforming and consuming data in highly distributed architectures.

To that extent, there exists an urging gap for automation frameworks that simplify data exchange between providers and consumers, namely for: (i) publishing data sets, (ii) generation of data usage agreements or contracts between parties, (iii) safe and contractual data exchange, and (iv) monitoring both during the exchange and during the consumer's use of the data obtained.

The purpose of the workshop is to bring together researchers and practitioners in the field of data architecture and data management with the aim of sharing ideas, perspectives and new solutions for scalable data sharing.

## Topics
The list of topics that the workshop will mainly address includes, but is not limited to:
- Trustworthy data sharing methods
- Automation of data governance
- Machine processable data sharing contracts
- Security and privacy mechanisms for secure data sharing
- Conceptual models supporting data sharing
- Data mesh adoptions in federated settings
- Data products architectures for data sharing
- AI-assisted methods for data sharing
- Energy, sustainability and cost awareness in data sharing
- Transformation mechanisms for data sharing
- Scalable architectures for data sharing

## Submission Instructions


[//]: # (TODO: Add submission instructions)
Papers shall be formatted using the 1-column [CEUR-ART style](http://ceur-ws.org/HOWTOSUBMIT.html), also available on [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/one-column-layout-template-for-submissions-to-ceur-workshop-proceedings-ceur-ws-dot-org/kwvphtkwrgsk).
Papers are to be submitted through EasyChair (the link will be available soon).
Accepted papers will be published in the CEUR proceedings. We generally solicit two types of research papers: 

* **Full Papers** (10 to 15 pages) provide complete solutions for any of the aforementioned research challenges. Full papers should include technical solutions and their empirical evaluations, describing novel concepts for addressing commonly encountered research problems.
* **Short Papers** (6 to 9 pages) describe innovative ideas of ongoing research or high-level concepts which have not yet been fully implemented and evaluated. We encourage authors to submit novel ideas which they would like to present and discuss within the workshop consortium.

Page counts include references and are not to be exceeded.
